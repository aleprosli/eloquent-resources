## For Learning Purpose

When creating an API, it can be useful to have a transformation layer that sits between your Eloquent models and the JSON responses that are returned to your application's users. This layer can help you display certain attributes for specific users or always include certain relationships in the JSON representation of your models. Eloquent's resource classes provide an easy and expressive way to transform your models and model collections into JSON. ---- [Laravel - Eloquent Resource](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-resources#conditional-attributes).
